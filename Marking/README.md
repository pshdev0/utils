find_copy_cats will list in copycats.txt all files containing pre-defined strings
java CopyCats will then copy those files into the copycats folder
you can then open that folder in code vs and investigate

java Process will create extract.js files inside folders containing files with certain regexes.
this is useful for collecting together functions of code for quick marking, rather than jumping between code files.
